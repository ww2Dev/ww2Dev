# Hello 👋, I'm John


![Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ww2Dev/ww2Dev/main/banner.png)

I'm a frontend-focused software engineer with 3 years of experience, mostly building interfaces with React and Next.js using TypeScript/Javascript.  

I’ve also worked with PHP and Laravel backends in the past, but my main focus is clean, smooth, interactive UI.
